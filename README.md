# Operation-Tough-Crowd

Lost in a crowd, the poison your rival spy gave you kicks in, you remember nothing - not even who you are. You must first find the informant to get a weapon then find your opponent in the crowd and take then out! Careful though, as if you kill the wrong person you will lose your weapon meaning the other player will get the upper hand!

This game was built during LD45 with the theme "Start with Nothing"
